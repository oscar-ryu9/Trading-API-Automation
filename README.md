# Trading API Automation

## MT5 

Using MetaTrader5, I made my own strategy to be coded onto it, which will not be shown here.

Then Using the MetaTrader5 API, I scrape the current market data and the visual ticks of my buy and sell signals.

## Interactive Brokers

Using interactive brokers, they offer a desktop version (TWS) with python API which connects directly into your interactive brokers account

Then using the current market buy and sell signals, I set up a automation of certain markets that I'm interested in in CSVs to buy and sell according to those signals

Then choosing the timeframe you want, the automation will be done throughout the day.

## Yields

The strategy I'm currently using is not tweaked to the fullest potential, but still coming at approximately 7% profit yearly, just under 3% of the average S&P 500 Index profits.
